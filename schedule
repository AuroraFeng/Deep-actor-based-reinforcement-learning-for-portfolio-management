# Aurora

9/12 -- 9/25
Proposal -- Aurora 

Data -- Yuan
    Walmart & Target -- Bloomberg & Thomson one
    S&P 500 
    VIX

    What is the longest time series that can be downloaded given frequency?
    1) Daily -- 2 years;
    2) Minute -- 3 months.
    
    Data of different assets can be asynchronous.
    
Paper -- Zhengdi & Pu
    Jiang, Z., Xu, D.& Liang, J.. A deep reinforcement learning framework for the financial portfolio management problem. 
    Working paper. July 2017.


9/26 -- 10/8 
Data -- Yuan & Zhengdi 

    Feature engineering -- price history (including close, high, low), S&P 500, VIX, federal funds rate, portfolio market value 
                           In addition, we consider correlation between asset returns. 
                            
                           To do: What else? 
                           
    Asset preselection
    1. Number -- 10 ~ 20 from multiple sectors & 3 ~ 5 from a single sector.
    2. Criteria 
      1) liquidity (measured by, possibly, ADTV);
      2) popularity (e.g., facebook and Google in tech sector).
      Both are reasonable criteria when an investor selects assets to include in his/her portfolio.
      The latter one can lead to comovements between asset returns.
    
    To do: Find all sectors; Select several popular sectors and assets.
    
    To do: Data exploration and processing  
    
    *Join implementation after data analysis is done.
    
Implementation -- Aurora & Pu

             Working paper. July 2017.
             
    General framework
    
    Component 
    *Yuan & Zhengdi may join in if they would like to.
    
Idea -- everyone
        
        Network architecture e.g. how and where to incorporate asset return comovements.
